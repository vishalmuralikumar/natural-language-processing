# Password test analysis 

 this project describe whether the password is "WEAK", "STRONG", "MEDIUM " 

In this project, I conducted semantic analysis and descriptive statistics to gain insights into the data's underlying patterns and characteristics.

I implemented feature importance and univariate analysis to identify key variables driving the target outcome and understand their individual impact.

Utilizing machine learning techniques such as linear regression, I modeled the relationships between variables and the target, achieving predictive accuracy and uncovering significant insights.

In addition, I leveraged NLP technique TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert textual data into numerical representations, enabling effective analysis and modeling.

Through this comprehensive approach, I contributed to robust data-driven decision-making and enhanced understanding of complex datasets.
